# The Outsider
Exploring the journey of perpetual curiosity and the perspective that comes from standing at the edges.

#### About Me
I've spent my life as both an outsider and an insider. From my days experimenting with internet technology in the early-1990s Virginia to building a career in Seattle's tech ecosystem without the "right" connections or pedigree, I've learned that being an outsider isn't just a challenge â€“ it's a perspective that brings unique value.

After over 30 years away, I've returned to Central Virginia, once again finding myself on the outside looking in. But this time, I bring decades of experience in technology leadership, innovation, and the hard-earned wisdom of someone who has repeatedly crossed the threshold from outsider to insider.
