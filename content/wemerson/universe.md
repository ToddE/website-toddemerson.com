I have no official qualifications to write about this topic. I am not a physicist. I'm not even an engineer. And there is very little mathematics behind what I will say. Indeed, I am finding that to advance the cause of understanding the Universe, it is almost necessary not to be any of these. 

This is because Scientists have created an article of faith around certain topics and will not allow anyone to challenge them. I expressed an adverse opinion about a particular theory in physics and one of the physicist approached me later and told me how 'brave' I was. She said she believed the same things, but that she could not say them. She knew she would be ridiculed by her profession and blackballed from doing any serious work or getting published.

Of course, on the other side of things, it is customary for the outsider or the non-believer to challenge the authority of the established community. So you will just have to make your own judgments.

I don't have a particular plan on how to lay this out. It would be nice to do it in an organized book like form carefully building up each point until I reach a climax about a single aspect of the universe. But I expect I'll just start right out assuming and describing the end product and then going back to demonstrate that at least some of the things are true.

**NOTE:** _This was Warren Emerson's last post on blogspot, though I believe he did a lot of this writing put never shared it with anyone._
