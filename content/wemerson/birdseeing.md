Bird watching seems to focus on what, how much and how many than "why" or even "how". This blog is about little things I have observed about birds. I call it Bird seeing because I am challenging people to actually think about what birds are doing and why. Most of this is likely to be obvious...once you think about it. But because of our human-centric view of things, we quickly forget and go back to seeing birds from a human point of view.

My credentials: None.

My breadth of travel in birdwatching: no greater than 50 feet from my back door--although this will likely change.

My approach: Fiddle around with variables and see how birds respond. Make a best guess as to why and do something else to see if it fits; hopefully, get some input and suggestions from others.

Consequently, if you want authoritative answers, you probably should look elsewhere. But if you are interested in applying your own insights to birds, then perhaps this will inspire you.
