The following posts were written by my father, Warren Emerson, on his [blogspot sites](https://www.blogger.com/profile/13775765927998628081) between 2006 and 2009:

* [The Philosophy Shoppe](/categories/philosophy-shoppe/)</br>
_"Commentary about life, justice, reality, the universe and occasionally something important"_
  
* [Bird Seeing](/categories/bird-seeing/)</br>
_"Dedicated to the idea that [birds are worth understanding](/wemerson/birdseeing/) from their point of view. It should be obvious that most of my bird watching is done in a small courtyard described in The Phantom Bird Feeder. We've noted that within a species there is a wide range of behavior related to individual bird's personality. Either inadvertently or purposefully, we conduct little experiments observing the range of reactions across species and within the species."_

My dad passed away in June of 2019. While my father and I weren't always close, I respected him for his thinking. He was ahead of time in many ways: "inventing" a hyperloop concept in the 90s, collecting methane from landfills to generate electricity in the 80s. He was always thinking and inventing, though selecting the right teams and executing on his ideas was never his strength.
