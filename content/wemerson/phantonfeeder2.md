[We noted in an earlier post](/wemerson/phantomfeeder/) that moving a feeder 18" caused birds to fly to the former location for several attempts. We have noted now, that moving it only a foot will do the same thing. Removing it (as we sometimes do to discourage squirrels) also creates the same effect.
